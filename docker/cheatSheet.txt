Important Commands of Docker 

1- docker images
    - this command will list all available images on your machine

2- docker ps 
    - similar to above , this will list all container on your machine , add -a if want all otherwise it will list only running containers

3- docker stop <contaienrId or name>
    this will stop a running container

4- docker start <contaienrId or name>

5- docker restart <containerId or name>

6- docker kill 
    forcefully stopping a container

7- docker logs <container name>
    fetch all logs from a container
     
8 - docker exec <container name> <command>
    basically helps you to run a command inside a running container ,widly used for debugging
    example docker exec my_container ls 


-- docker build -t <image name> 
    when you make a dockerFile to create a custom Image run this command to build your image

-- docker build -e PORT=3000 -it <image name> 
to pass Environemnt variables in Image ,  run this command , imagine i want to pass PORT as an env i'd have to pass it with ' -e ' 

-- docker run -p 3000:3000 <image name>
    since containers are isolated we have to Expose their ports using port mapping
    run your image with port mapping , means yourPort:ContainerPort , you can use it on the same port as well as change itv

when you do this 
    => docker exec <containerId> bash
    it will goto promop shell then you can write 
    => " cat index.js" to check the content of index.js
