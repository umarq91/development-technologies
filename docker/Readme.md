# This is me Learning docker as an Absolute beginner / never learned or used before

<!-- Problem -->
imagine I use node10 ,redis 5,react 17 and many more things to setup my developement enviroment and in future or on someone else machine these version are updated or not available  .  they might have some issues . 

    Problems we will have to face if we don't use / learn docker !
 1 - Environment Incosistency 
    - Development vs Production Discrepancies : without docker , your developement environment might differ from your production environment
    leads to bugs and issues
    - Team Enviroment Variability : Each Developer might have slightly different setup on their local machines , causing the infamous 
    "this works on my machine" problem

2 -   Complex Dependencies Management
    - Dependency Conflicts : Managing different version of dependencies for various projects can become cumbersome . 
        Docker Isolates dependencies for each application ,avoiding conflicts
    - setup complexity : you know...

3- Deployment Challenges 
    - Manual Deployment Processes : without docker , deploying apps can involve compelex , error-prone manual setups . Docker allows for more
        streamlined and repeatable deployment Process
    - Scalability Issues : docker makes it easier

4- Testing and CI / CD Difficulties
    - Inconsistent Testing Enviorments
    - Complicated CI/CD pipelines


    and many many more issues that we face
